Natural language transpiler... Need a good dataset of code and descriptions, though, Could use a CycleGAN style thing. 
I wonder how a game created using Intrinsic UDRL would look like...?
How does the Transformer model perform under varying initialization strategies? 
Since Foobar, I've been wondering about A*, and it's usages. I didn't use A* though, because I'm Dumbo the Elephant, and I thought that BFS was 'good enough'... Did not realize that Foobar might've wanted the efficient solution...
RL is really just effective graph search...
